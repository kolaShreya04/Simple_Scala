### Three Elements I Liked About Using Scala for the Project:
1. **Expressive Syntax**: Scala's concise and expressive syntax made it easy to write clean and readable code.
2. **Functional Programming Features**: Leveraging functional programming features such as pattern matching and immutable data structures simplified handling state and logic.
3. **Interoperability with Java**: Scala's seamless interoperability with Java allowed me to leverage existing Java libraries and frameworks.

### Three Elements of Scala I Did Not Like (At Least Not As Much):
1. **Steep Learning Curve**: Scala has a steep learning curve, especially for developers unfamiliar with functional programming concepts.
2. **Complexity**: Scala's powerful features can sometimes lead to complex code, making it harder to debug and maintain.
3. **Tooling Support**: Although improving, tooling support for Scala, especially in terms of IDEs, can still lag behind other languages like Java.
